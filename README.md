## Instructions



### Get Started

Look at the `index.html` again. What elements will we need to access?
> HINT: Why do we use `id` in HTML over `class`?

In your `js/main.js` put a `console.log` and run your index.html in your browser to check that everything is linked up correctly. Once you've tested that, make a reference to a couple of things in the HTML that we'll need to access consistently.
* `<h2 id="movement">`: This will display the x and y coordinates of our hero so we can see what's going on.
```javascript
let movementDisplay = document.getElementById('movement')
```
* `<canvas id="game">`: This is the main piece of our game; it's where we will be rendering our game an what we will be updating.
```javascript
let game = document.getElementById('game')
```

Computers function on numbers, so we need to translate our problem into numbers. Thankfully, we have a graph to solve our problem. 

### What is a box compared to rocks and mountains?
