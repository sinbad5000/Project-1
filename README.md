# Canvas Crawl Away From Earth!

Hi! Welcome to my game

## Getting Started

Basically, I took our old Canvas Crawler code along and turned it into a full functioning game!


## Goals

* To build multiple levels
* To implement an anti-cheat system
* Give a unique look and a basic plot
* Title and Credit screens


## Instructions

* Use W A S D to navigate to the exit without getting hit by the bad guys 
* Don't cheat ;)

### My Ideas for Stretch Goals

* Instead of where it says "easy/medium/hard" I was thinking of putting a countdown timer
* I was thinking of adding treasure to collect before the door appears
* I wanted to put images on the hero and bad guys, and make the door look like a door 

### Make Some Characters!

I made a lot more characters! Well, bad guys, and I made them move!

## How I linked files

I had some trouble linking all my pages but Pete helped me realize I just needed to use .action, so that is fixed now!


#### The function

 To build a basic game and showcase my skills in I've learned in the first 3 weeks

## When Worlds Collide

I used the same collision detection code but changed it up a bit. I had to make a unique one that silently detected when you went out of bounds as well for the anti-cheat and I definitely added more since now I have multiple bad guys moving around the screen.  

### What is a box compared to rocks and mountains?

Here is where I want to change the boxes into pics, but I'm leaving that as a stretch goal


## Additional Resources

* used google images and the stock images that came with Canvas Crawler 
* used bensound.com for the free music and borrowed some SFX and music from Whip-a-Wimp on github (was looking around for inspiration)
